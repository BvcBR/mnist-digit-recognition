# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
## Overview
This project focuses on building and training a simple neural network to accurately recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It serves as an introductory exploration into the basics of neural networks, including understanding different layers, activation functions, and the process of training a model with PyTorch.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can take an image of a handwritten digit as input and predict the digit as accurately as possible. Through this project, you can gain practical experience with the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

## Features
Data preprocessing and visualization of the MNIST dataset.
Building a neural network model using Pytorch's Neural Network Module.
Training the model and evaluating its performance on unseen data.
Experimentation with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
## Technologies Used
**Programming Language:** Python.  
**Libraries/Frameworks:** Pytorch, Matplotlib.  
**Dataset:** MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset.
