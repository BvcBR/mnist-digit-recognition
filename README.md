# mnist-digit-recognition
This project focuses on building and training a simple neural network to accurately recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. It serves as an introductory exploration into the basics of neural networks, including understanding different layers, activation functions, and the process of training a model with Pytorch.
